This repository demonstrates a common error encountered when building Android projects with the Expo CLI. The problem arises from a mismatch between the Android Gradle Plugin (AGP) version used in the project and the version supported by the Expo CLI. This incompatibility leads to build failures during the Android build process. The solution provided shows how to resolve the version conflict and successfully build the app.
