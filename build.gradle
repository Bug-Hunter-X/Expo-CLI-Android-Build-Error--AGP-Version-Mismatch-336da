This error occurs when using the Expo CLI to build an Android app and involves a mismatch between the Android Gradle Plugin (AGP) version specified in your project's `android/build.gradle` file and the version supported by the Expo CLI.  The specific error message might vary, but it generally points to a Gradle sync failure or a build process issue related to AGP version incompatibility. For example, you might encounter errors related to dependencies not found or conflicts between different Gradle versions.
