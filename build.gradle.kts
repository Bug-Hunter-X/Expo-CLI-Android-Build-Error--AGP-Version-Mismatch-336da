The solution involves updating the `android/build.gradle` file (or `android/build.gradle.kts` for Kotlin projects) to use an AGP version compatible with your Expo CLI version.  You can find the recommended AGP version in the Expo documentation or by checking the version used in similar, successfully built Expo projects.  If updating the AGP version directly is challenging, an alternative could be to modify your project's Gradle version to be compatible. This should resolve dependency conflicts and allow the build process to complete successfully.  Always ensure to sync your project's Gradle files after making any changes.
